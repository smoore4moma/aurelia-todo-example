# aurelia-todo-example

>This is a working version of the Aurelia ToDo tutorial which you can find here:  http://aurelia.io/docs/tutorials/creating-a-todo-app/

>The tutorial as it stands today (2019-04-17) does not work, or at least it does not work well.  There is an accompanying Introduction to Aurelia video on the aurelia.io homepage that shows how to build the same thing, but even that has minor issues.  This repo works through the minor issues and is a good starting point for someone who is trying to get the ToDo app to work.

## Running The App

To run the app, follow these steps.

1. Ensure that [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) is installed. This provides the platform on which the build tools runs.
2. From the project folder, execute the following command:

  ```shell
  npm install
  ```
